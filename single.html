        <h1>My Favourite Place:</h1>
        <p class="places">My Favourite place is Karbala and the capital of Pakistan Islamabad</p>
        <h1>Karbala:</h1>
        <center><img width="523" src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/karbala-imam-hossein-iraq-arbaeen-beynolharamayn-moharram-ashoora-tasooa-haram-zarih-mosque_967868-5653.jpg?semt=ais_hybrid" alt=""><img width="550" src="https://wallpapers.com/images/high/imam-hossain-shrine-sunset-karbala-o7gi6pd6dc1ttbir.webp" alt=""></center>
        <p class="favourite">Karbala, a city in Iraq, holds deep significance as one of the most revered places in Islamic history. It is the site of the tragic Battle of Karbala, where Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, and his companions were martyred in 680 AD. This event has left an indelible mark on the hearts of millions of Muslims worldwide, symbolizing 
            the ultimate sacrifice for justice, truth, and faith. The city is a major pilgrimage destination, especially during the annual observance of Ashura, attracting millions of visitors who come to pay their respects. The atmosphere in Karbala is one of deep spirituality, reflection, and devotion. The shrines of Imam Hussain and his brother Abbas are
             the focal points of this city, offering a place for prayer, reflection, and a connection to the past. The streets are filled with the sounds of mourning, prayers, and the shared grief of those who come to honor their memory. The beauty of Karbala lies not only in its historical significance but also in the sense of unity and faith that it inspires in all who visit</p>

        <p class="islamabad">Islamad is also my favourite palace because the capital of Pakistan is very beautiful. In my view i think the total beauty of Pakistan is in the Islamabad.Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan, is my favorite place due to its serene beauty and breathtaking landscapes. Surrounded by lush green hills and a pleasant climate, it offers a peaceful retreat from the hustle and
             bustle of city life. The city is well-planned, with wide roads, beautiful parks, and iconic landmarks like the Faisal Mosque. I love visiting the Daman-e-Koh viewpoint, which offers a stunning panoramic view of the city Islamabadâ€™s blend of modern architecture and natural beauty makes it an ideal place for relaxation and a perfect escape for nature lovers.</p>
